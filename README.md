ChatLink is a free, easy to install, online software that only requires the person who wishes to use ChatLink to click one button. Because the Software runs itself as an .exe, the user must only go to the website and click "Download for" and either "Windows," "Linux," or "Mac."

ChatLink is designed to allow users to speak to other users in high quality voice parties online. Parties, or a private group of users, can be made to communicate only to those you want to speak to, while platforms are open to all users. This software can be used to discuss strategy in a competitive game or just casual talk amongst friends.
